                <p>Honestly, I was ready to start working on a solo album. I had a bunch of music I was sitting on. I
                    was
                    going to ask Lars [Metallica's drummer] to play drums on it</p>

                <p>For me, music comes at all times of the day. When I get a riff, sometimes it's a complete riff
                    and I
                    can
                    just play it and there it is, sometimes it's half a riff and I have to tweak it. Sometimes it's
                    just
                    a
                    rhythm or a note selection. Or sometimes it's just something that I hum in my head. But it can
                    come
                    from
                    anywhere, and I put it on my phone, and I make sure the phone is fucking backed up.</p>
